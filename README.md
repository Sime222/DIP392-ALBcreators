This is an easy implimitation of connect-4 game with some updates. The difference oin this game is that the game
does not finish when the game is over but when the player has gathered a specific points. The inteferance is achived
whith a python module called pygame and first it runs in a simple menu where he choses to play with two players or to playe with 
trhe computer. The turn is chosen randomly by the computer. In this implimitation are used different modules where the most
important are pygame and nympay.

A requirement for this code is:
To download pygame:
open cmd and run: pip install pygame

the same with numpy
pip install numpy

as those modules are not downloaded but only included as directories to install later
